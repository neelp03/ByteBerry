## ByteBerry

**ByteBerry** is a decentralized file storage system built using **IPFS** and **Ethereum** smart contracts. It allows users to securely upload files to a decentralized network and store the file metadata on the blockchain, ensuring ownership and immutability. The project leverages modern web technologies like **SvelteKit** and **Web3.js** for the frontend, and **Solidity** for smart contract development.

### Key Features:
- **Decentralized Storage with IPFS**: Store files on IPFS, a peer-to-peer network for decentralized file storage.
- **Blockchain-powered Metadata**: Use Ethereum smart contracts to store file metadata, ensuring secure and immutable ownership records.
- **Ethereum Wallet Integration**: Seamlessly connect with MetaMask to manage file uploads and interact with the blockchain.
- **Modern UI**: Built with **SvelteKit** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.

### Technologies Used:
- **SvelteKit**: Frontend framework for building fast and modern web applications.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage network for secure and scalable file storage.
- **Ethereum**: Smart contracts written in **Solidity** to manage file metadata and ownership on the blockchain.
- **Web3.js**: Blockchain interaction and Ethereum wallet connectivity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing a clean and responsive user interface.

### Future Plans:
- Add encryption for secure file uploads.
- Implement a user-friendly file management dashboard.
- Expand to support additional decentralized storage networks.
